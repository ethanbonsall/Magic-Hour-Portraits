        Hi! I’m Ethan, originally from Camp Hill, PA, and currently an
        undergraduate studying Computer Science at UNC Chapel Hill. I’m a member
        of Computer Science & Social Good, where I help develop websites and
        apps for nonprofit organizations. My expertise includes web development
        and artificial intelligence. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing
        soccer, tennis, hiking, cheering on the Steelers, and spending time with
        friends. I am currently an Associate Programmer Intern at Sheetz.
